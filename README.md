# Mobile Native Application Development Coursework

This app is a simplistic recreation of the Apple IOS default weather app.

This application has the following features:

1. Tab: Now
This view provides location details and the date, along with some common weather elements with icons. The region above the tab navigation bar is used to show some of the common air quality elements with images and values.

2. Tab: 5-Day Weather
This view gives a rich weather view of the current location, with the top part a scrollable view showing a summary of hourly weather for the next 48 hours and the bottom part a vertically scrollable view showing summarised weather for each of the following 5 days for the current location.

3. Tab: Place Map
This view is a compound view, with the top part showing a map with pins of 5 top tourist attractions places and the bottom part of a scrollable list of the tourist places using MapKit.

4. Tab: Stored Places
This view provides location names as a list. Each time a new location is searched, if it exists, its name and geo-coordinates are stored in the database and retrieved when this location is searched again. Swipe action to delete a location permanently is also part of this view.
